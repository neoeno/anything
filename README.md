This was based off of [Pliny](http://github.com/ascott1/Pliny) which is Super
Great and you should Check It Out Mate.

Then I changed a load of stuff really badly. I don't care. Stop stalking my
github RECRUITERS.

WHAT FOLLOWS IS MOST OF THE ORIGINAL README SAVED FOR GOOD MEMORIES

## Dependencies

Pliny relies on:

* [node/npm](http://nodejs.org/)
* Grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Sass: `gem install sass`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo into your Ghost `themes` directory `git clone git@github.com:ascott1/Pliny.git`
2. `cd` into the directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt watch` to keep an eye on your Sass and JavaScript files
